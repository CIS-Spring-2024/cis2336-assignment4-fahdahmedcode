During my testing phase, I came across some alignment issues with the user interface which particularly affected the buttons and text layout on the page. I focused on correcting the centering of the category buttons such as "All," "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Dinner," and "Dessert." This required tweaking the CSS properties for .category-buttons to ensure they were properly centered by adjusting the justify-content and modifying their margins for consistent spacing. Additionally, the headers "Restaurant Menus" and the text underneath weren't aligning with the buttons, which disrupted the visual flow. To fix this, I applied a text-align: center; style directly to these elements, aligning them with the buttons above. I also improved the responsive design aspects of the application to make sure that the layout adapts smoothly across different devices. This involved refining media queries to adjust the scaling and positioning of menu items and images, ensuring they look good on both large and small screens.

This project encompasses a comprehensive website for UH-Sugarland Cafeteria, which includes several user-friendly pages. The Main Page acts as the landing page that greets visitors with an inviting overview of the cafeteria, along with navigation links to various sections. The About Page offers a description of me, the cafeteria's owner and chef, detailing my culinary journey and the inspiration behind the establishment. This personal touch aims to build a connection with the audience. The Contact Page features a user-friendly form, allowing visitors to easily communicate with the cafeteria, whether for feedback or inquiries.

Additionally, the Menu Page showcases a wide array of food options available for order. Each item is presented with a description and price, enhancing the user's browsing and selection process. Items can be added to a cart where users can modify quantities and see a running total. The integration of a Checkout Functionality—developed using Node.js and Express—enables the backend to handle order submissions. It processes the cart's contents to calculate the total cost and guides users to a confirmation page upon checkout.
